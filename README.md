# consuming-rest
kotlin version with gradle of spring boot guide:https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/

Due to uncertain availability of the service  https://quoters.apps.pcfone.io/api/random which is used to retrieve a random Spring Boot quotation, we've created a provider of random quotation.

Start provider first, then consumer.
